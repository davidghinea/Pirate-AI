# Pirate AI

**Pirate AI** is a TypeScript app that runs on the terminal, integrating with Gemini AI to let you chat with a pirate. I made this in less than an hour, the code is minimal.

## How to Run

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add your configuration like so:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

And there ye have it! Hoist the sails and enjoy yer piratey conversations wit' ol' Dread Pirate Roberts!
